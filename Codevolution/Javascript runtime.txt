chrome comprises of 
--> JS engine (has the call stac and the memory to store variables)
--> Browser APIs (These include the DOM local storage, timer fxns, and promises )
--> Event Loop (ensures that tasks are executed in the correct order)
What is node js
- Allows use of javascript  outside the Browser
What can you build with node js
 - APIs
 -CMD tools
 - Multiplayer tools
 - Streaming services
 - Backend services
 - Real time applications
Node JS is comprises a JS library, built with C++ and has various dependencies
Does not have acess to the web API unlike the JS runtime
window and document objects cannot be found in the library
NODE REPL is the JS Read Evaluate Print Loop
similar to the rails console
difference between Browser and node
no modules in Browser
Browser APIs are noot available in node
Node.js has more freedom for dev
Modules in Node
- local
- Built-in
- Third Party (written by other devs)

The code is the same due to IIFE
In IFFE each variable has its own scope
BEfore execution a mudule is treated like an IIFE
This allows for encapsulation and reusability
//Module wrapper
The module wraper is used to covert the module code into an IIFE
thus a module looks like This
(
    function(exports, require, module, __filename, __dirname){
        module code
    }
)
the variables in the module wrapper are usually injected during execution by 
in the code the value of superhero is superman even if the exported value is batman because of module caching.
Module caching can be used to refere to the situation where a module is saved with its
When one object is assign to the other in JS both point to the same addres in memory thus the observed effect
Common JS
Each file is treated as a module
the module.exports tells which parts to exported
imorting is done using common JSES modules are a new version 
no module system when node was created
ES6 created a standard module system on 2006
The eky modules in node are
-- path - provides utilities for working with directories
-- Event
-- http
-- fx
-- stream
Callbacks in node
--> Used where functions can be used as arguments and can also be returned 
there are two types of Callbacks
--> Synchrounous - this is executed imidiately it is called such as the ones passed to the array methods sort map and filter methods.
and asynchrounous - used to resume code execution after an asynchrounous operation completes 
These are common in JS where some one if fetching data from a file, database, or making a network request
Event module allows as to work with events in javascript
Event refers to an action that happened in the application that one can reply to
Events module also allows us to dispatch custom events ad respond to them in a non blocking manner
AS seen in the use of different pizza and drink classes is that it is possible to used different classes without tight coupling
Character sets
encoding
Async JS
Streams and buffers
characters are fist converted to numbers then to their respective binary representation
character sets --> predefined character list rep by nums 
most common are unicode and ASCII
Character encoding --> describes how to represent as binary befor being stored into a computer
How many bits to be used to represent a number
Example is uTF-8 which sipulate that characters should be repped in bytes(in this case 8 bits to make a byte)
Thus in the case of 4 --> binary 100 --> unicode --> 00000100 
There are also guidlines on the storage of images and videos in binary format
Streams --> refers to data being moved from one point to the other
can bee within the computer, across internets and intranets
Node JS processes data in chunks and not waited to be wholly available
eg as when a video can be watched even if it is not fuully downloaded
Using chunks helps prevent unecessary downloads and ensuring that the data arrives in time
This helps prevent unecessary data downloads and memory use
buffers
It the wait zone that has a definite minimum and maximum data to be sent/processeed
Simply it a small area of the runtime that is maintained to process that data stream
For intance when the internet connection is fast the data stream will fill the buffer faster
The loading spiner on a video shows that it is waiting for more data to full the buffer so that it can send it
Buffer have limited memory thus when writing to the buffer only the characters that match the length will be written in the buffer
Buffers form the foundation for which node works
Asynch JS
JS is blocking and single threaded in its simplest form
A single thread can only handle one task at a time
New pieces beyond JS are required to write Asynch code
Browsers help that for the front-end and browsers for the backend
The browser and Node helps create functions that are invonked asynchronously when an event occurs
e.g in setTimeouts, event listeners, callbacks, promises 
the FS module
Streams and pipes
Although it works the same ase the read file the streaming wors best when working with big files
with big files files can be streams in chaunks while copying to a new file
Types of streams
--> readable streams for reading files (readable stream)
--> writable streams where we write (writable stream)
--> Duplex streams that are both writable and readable (sockets)
--> Transform streams that allow for reading and writing of data as it is being read (file compression)
Pipes
used to connect readable streams to writable streams
